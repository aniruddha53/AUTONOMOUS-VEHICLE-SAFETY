Objective:
  1. Roads are essential to our everyday lives. We all use them in some way, by driving, riding, walking or travelling as a passenger, 
     and we depend on them to obtain goods and services.
  2. Unfortunately, this comes at a price, which includes people being killed and injured. However, road deaths and injuries are not inevitable. The last few decades have demonstrated that effective and comprehensive road safety strategies can reduce the number of      people killed or injured on the road, despite increasing traffic levels.
  3. Thus, controlling vehicle motion and directions to avoid collisions by monitoring relative speed, position and direction of other        vehicles to ensure safety of autonomous vehicles is the main objective of this project.

Components Used:
  Adeept Mars Rover PiCar-B WiFi Smart Robot Car, Raspberry Pi3, Raspberry Pi Camera, 1 DC motor, 3 Servo motors, 2 RGB LEDs

Software:
  Python,
  OpenCV,
  NumPy

 Accomplishments:
 1. Successfully assembled smart robot car from the scratch.
 2. Succesfully controlled motion of all the three servo motors and the DC motor which controlled the forward and backward movement
    of the vehicle. 
 3. Successfully detected objects using OpenCV and Picamera. Implemented a Python script such that whenever the vehicle detected an
    object in its path, vehicle takes right or left turn (based on the current lane and position of other objects).
 4. Implemented plane to plane homography using OPenCV to convert the picture frames to a birds-eye-view so as to analyze road-signs
    and avoid potholes.
